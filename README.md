Full Stack Question Paper â€“ VIT (REST API)
This project is a simple REST API built with Node.js and Express that solves the problem described in the VIT Full Stack Question Paper.

Objective
The API provides a single endpoint /bfhl that accepts a POST request with an array of strings. It processes this array to separate numbers, alphabets, and special characters, and returns a structured JSON response.

Tech Stack
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.

Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
